CHOOSE ONE: Please apply the random forest to one of the following datasets.
- the `iris` dataset.
- the dating dataset.
- the `titanic` dataset.
- the `MNIST` dataset.

Please answer the following questions.
1. Please use grid search to find the good `max_leaf_nodes` and `max_depth`.
2. Please record the cross-validation score and the OOB score of your model and compare it with the models you learned before (kNN, Decision Trees). 
3. 
    - Please find some typical features (using the Gini importance) and draw the Decision Boundary against the features you choose. 
    - If you choose `MNIST`, you don't need to draw the Decision Boundary. Instead you draw a `28x28` picture display the importance of each pixels.
