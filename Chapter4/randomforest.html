<p>One approach to get many estimators is to use the same training algorithm for every predictor and train them on different random subsets of the training set. When sampling is performed with replacement, this method is called <em>bagging</em> (short for <em>bootstrap aggregating</em>). When sampling is performed without replacement, it is called <em>pasting</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. The dataset is the one we used in Chpater 3: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make_moon</span></code>. We split the dataset into training and test sets.</p>

<p>We would like to sample from the dataset to get some smaller minisets. We will use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn.model_selection.ShuffleSplit</span></code> to perform the action.</p>
<p>The output of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ShuffleSplit</span></code> is a generator. To get the index out of it we need a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loop. You may check out the following code.</p>
<p>Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ShuffleSplit</span></code> is originally used to shuffle data into training and test sets. We would only use the shuffle function out of it, so we will set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test_size</span></code> to be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> and use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_</span></code> later in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loop since we won’t use that part of the information.</p>
<p>What we finally get is a generator <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rs</span></code> that produces indexes of subsets of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X_train</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y_train</span></code>.</p>

<p>Now we would like to generate a list of Decision Trees. We could use the hyperparameters we get from Chapter 3. We train each tree over a certain mini set, and then evaluate the trained model over the test set. The average accuracy is around 80%.</p>
<p>Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rs</span></code> is a generator. We put it in a for loop, and during each loop it will produce a list of indexes which gives a subset. We will directly train our model over the subset and use it to predict the test set. The result of each tree is put in the list <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y_pred_list</span></code> and the accuracy is stored in the list <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">acc_list</span></code>. The mean of the accuracy is then computed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.mean(acc_list)</span></code>.</p>

<p>The point of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bagging</span></code> is to let every classifier study part of the data, and then gather the opinions from everyone. If the performance are almost the same between individual classifers and the Bagging classifiers, this means that the majority of the individual classifiers have the same opinions. One possible reason is that the randomized subsets already catch the main features of the dataset that every individual classifiers behave similar.</p>

<p>The two accuracy has some differences, but not much. This is due to the fact that the sample size of the subset is too large: 1000 can already help the individual classifers to capture the major ideas of the datasets.

<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.5.1. </span>Extra-trees<a class="headerlink" href="#extra-trees" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>When growing a Decision Tree, our method is to search through all possible ways to find the best split point that get the lowest Gini impurity. Anohter method is to use a random split. Of course a random tree performs much worse, but if we use it to form a random forest, the voting system can help to increase the accuracy. On the other hand, random split is much faster than a regular Decision Tree.</p>
<p>This type of forest is called <em>Extremely Randomized Trees</em>, or <em>Extra-Trees</em> for short. We could modify the above random forest classifier code to implement the extra-tree algorithm. The key point is that we don’t apply the Decision Tree algorithm to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X_subset</span></code>. Instead we perform a random split.</p>

<p>From the above example, you may find a significant increase in the performace from the mean individual accuracy to the Extra-tree classifier accuracy. The accuracy of the Extra-tree classifier is also very close to what we get from the original data points, although its base classifier is much simpler.</p>
<p>In <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code> there is an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ExtraTreesClassifier</span></code> to create such a classifier. It is hard to say which random forest is better beforehand. What we can do is to test and calculate the cross-validation scores (with grid search for hyperparameters tuning).</p>

<p>After training a Decision Tree, we could look at each node. Each split is against a feature, which decrease the Gini impurity the most. In other words, we could say that the feature is the most important during the split.</p>
<p>Using the average Gini impurity decreased as a metric, we could measure the importance of each feature. This is called <em>Gini importance</em>. If the feature is useful, it tends to split mixed labeled nodes into pure single class nodes.</p>
<p>In the case of random forest, since there are many trees, we might compute the weighted average of the Gini importance across all trees. The weight depends on how many times the feature is used in a specific node.</p>
<p>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RandomForestClassifier</span></code>, we can directly get access to the Gini importance of each feature by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.feature_importance_</span></code>. Please see the following example.</p>

<p>In this example, you may see that the two features are relavely equally important, where the second feature is slightly more important since on average it decrease the Gini impurity a little bit more.</p>
